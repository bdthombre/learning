    "- Linear layers work like multiclass logistic regression with `in_features` and `out_features`.\n",

    "- Main activation function is currently `ReLU` or `LeakyReLU`\n",
    "- Main problem with `sigmoid` and `tanh` is saturation and dying gradient (though there are used in some neural network blocks like recurrent)\n",
    "- `ReLU` may suffer from dying neurons phenomena which may impact neural network\n",
    "- Though it is not the most probable cause of poor network performance\n",
    "- Remember to use wide layers (say `50`, `100` neurons), depending on task (if the model does not learn, it might need more parameters)\n",
